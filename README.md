# Binary Search in Swift

Binary search is a simple algorithm that lets you search an array for a specific value. It’s trivial to implement in Swift, which makes it exceptionally helpful for beginners as an introduction into algorithms. 

Binary search works by constantly dividing the array of numbers in half, until we’ve found the number we’re looking for. Because the array is sorted, we can use logic to figure out in which half of the array the number is.
